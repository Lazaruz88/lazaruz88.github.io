First time hosting a Minecraft server? Don’t worry, we’re here to help.

## Selecting what type of Minecraft server you want to have
Minecraft has many different versions of servers, so we'll give you a short explanation of the most common ones.

* Vanilla  
It's a completely regular Minecraft server, without any mods or plugins.  
Commonly used by groups of friends that just want to enjoy a few hours together on Minecraft.

* Paper and Spigot  
Spigot is a plugin capable server, allowing you to add modifications to your server.
Spigot on it's own is much more performance friendly compared to a vanilla server.
See examples of plugins [here](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/)

Paper is a fork of Spigot, giving the server even better performance.  
It supports most of the plugins Spigot can use, but not all.

Both Paper and Spigot can be joined by an unmodified client, which makes it a lot easier for clients to join.

* Forge  
Forge is a mod compatible version, allowing to to make changes and/or add new content.
Mods can be found at [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks)

* Other  
There are several other Minecraft server versions.  
Search on your own, or contact us if you want to know more.

* To sum it up:  
If you're planning to run a vanilla server, we recommend selecting `Paper`

Paper is very easy to set up, easy to configure, runs smoothly and you have the possibility to add plugins at a later point.
