PayPal's Subscribe feature requires that a PayPal account have a Credit Card attached to it in order to Subscribe.

You can pay without a Bank, Debit or Credit card by following these instructions:

1. Select your Invoice
2. Select PayPal Checkout instead of PayPal Subscribe
Because of this you will be required to pay future invoices manually.

You can pay Invoices from the My Invoices section.
